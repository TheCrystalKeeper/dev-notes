      <p class="lead">I am a Software Engineer and Computer Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
      <p>
        My work focuses on building end-to-end software systems with an emphasis on performance, developer experience, and thoughtful user interfaces.
        I have professional experience developing production desktop applications, backend services, and developer-facing tools, and I enjoy working across the stack to take ideas from early prototypes to reliable, real-world products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Broadly, I am interested in systems programming, developer tools, and interactive software. My portfolio showcases a mix of technical projects, game development work, and writing, reflecting my interest in building software that is both technically rigorous and engaging to use.
